# ðŸ§ ðŸ“Š Neural Network vs Decision Tree

This project compares two classic machine learning models:

* A **single-layer neural network** trained with gradient descent
* The **ID3 decision tree algorithm** based on information gain

We tested them on the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset** to see which one performs better and why.

## ðŸ§ª Dataset

We used the [Breast Cancer dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html) from scikit-learn.

* 30 features
* Binary classification (malignant or benign)
* Split: 80% training / 20% test

## ðŸ“Œ What We Learned

* Neural networks give better accuracy but need careful tuning (learning rate, epochs).
* Decision trees are easier to understand and faster to train but can overfit.
* Visualizing both models helped us understand their decisions better.
